# Pokemon Mod for Terraria (In Development)

This repository contains the source code for my first Terraria mod, which is currently under development and not yet complete. The mod aims to bring some of the mechanics from the Pok√©mon franchise into the world of Terraria, such as capturing and battling creatures with pokeballs.

## Features

- New Pokeball item that allows players to capture wild Pokemon
- Pokemon NPCs that can be battled and caught
- A new battle system that allows players to battle with their caught Pokemon

## Contributing

As this is my first mod, any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

## Disclaimer

Please note that this mod is still a work in progress and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or other issues. Use it at your own risk, and keep in mind that it is not yet polished or fully tested.
